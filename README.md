linux_scrypts
=============

This Repo has a collection of files which I use frequently to setup Linux on my computers(Macbook Pro 9,1 and AMD CPU based PC). 
The final aim of many of the files is to make an unattended scrypt to take care of system setup. But right now these are more like a source from where I can copy paste instructions quickly.

Files and their desctiption:
1. Macbookpro_ubuntu14.04_linux_installation_settings.sh    : Tested for Ubuntu 14.04 setup on MacbookPro 9,1
2. Mint17_amd_setup.sh        : Tested for Mint17 setup on AMD CPU with AMD GPU(R9-290)
3. Python_related.sh          : Python related tools. Still not usefull enough
4. linux_misc_scrypt.sh       : Lists generic commands and tools which can be used at various times 
5. open_cv_scrypt.sh          : Has instructions for ffmpeg, Opencv 2.4.9, Leptonica 1.7, Tesseract3.03, openalpr .2 setup for AMD and NVIDIA based CPU's on 64 bit platforms
